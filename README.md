# claybust-mame-artwork

Artwork for use with "ClayBuster" (claybust) in mame

Version 2.02

- Artwork type: Bezel, backdrop
- Hut artwork by Coolname
- Lay file by Widge
- Scenery artwork from various sources obtained under Creative Commons Licence
- Original logos, artwork and trademarks are property of their respective owners.
- Version 2 (slightly reworked to eliminate deprecated "backdrop" and "Bezel" types)
- Removed Standard (4:3) option in favour of the wide backdrop and bezel view as MAME's "Zoom to Screen Area" option has the same effect.
- V 2.2 - Separated the water from the bezel in order to apply a semi-transperancy to allow the animated graphic to make the water seem "alive". Also  cleaned up some of the bezel edges.
