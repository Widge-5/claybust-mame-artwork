- Lay file by Widge
- Scenery artwork from various sources obtained in the public domain.
- Version 2.0 (slightly reworked to eliminate deprecated "backdrop" type)
- Removed Standard (4:3) option in favour of the wide backdrop and bezel view as MAME's "Zoom to Screen Area" option has the same effect.
